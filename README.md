# Business-License-Status-Classification
This project aims to predict whether a business license should be Issued (AAI), Renewed (REV), or Cancelled (AAC) based on historical application data and business characteristics. The model supports faster and smarter decision-making in license processing.

🧠 What I Did
Performed data cleaning and preprocessing on raw license application data (handling missing values, simplifying license types, etc.).

Engineered new features such as matching business and legal names to improve model performance.

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand class distributions and feature importance.

Built and compared classification models using TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, and H2O.ai to identify the best-performing model based on accuracy.

Visualized class frequencies and model outputs using Matplotlib and Seaborn for better interpretability.

📈 Output
The final output is a trained deep learning model that classifies license applications into one of three statuses: AAI, AAC, or REV, helping authorities make quick and data-backed decisions.
